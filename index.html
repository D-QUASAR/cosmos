       A black hole is a region in space where the pulling force of gravity
     is so strong that light is not able to escape. The strong gravity 
     occurs because matter has been pressed into a tiny space. This 
     compression can take place at the end of a star's life. Some black 
     holes are a result of dying stars.

     <br>
       Because no light can escape, black holes are invisible. However,
     space telescopes with special instruments can help find black holes.
     They can observe the behavior of material and stars that are very 
     close to black holes.

       Shining so brightly that they eclipse the ancient galaxies that 
       contain them, quasars are distant objects powered by black holes a 
       billion times as massive as our sun. These powerful dynamos have 
       fascinated astronomers since their discovery half a century ago.

     In the 1930s, Karl Jansky, a physicist with Bell Telephone Laboratories, discovered that the static interference on transatlantic phone lines was coming from the Milky Way. By the 1950s, astronomers were using radio telescopes to probe the heavens, and pairing their signals with visible examinations of the heavens.
    However, some of the smaller point-source objects didn't have a match. Astronomers called them "quasi-stellar radio sources," or "quasars," because the signals came from one place, like a star. However, the name is a misnomer; according to the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan, only about 10 percent of quasars emit strong radio waves.
    Naming them didn't help determine what these objects were. It took years of study to realize that these distant specks, which seemed to indicate stars, are created by particles accelerated at velocities approaching the speed of light.

  <div class="col d-flex justify-content-center">
   <p class="lead" style="font-weight: 900;">
    The cosmic microwave background (CMB, CMBR), in Big Bang cosmology, is electromagnetic 
    radiation which is a remnant from an early stage of the universe, also known as "relic 
    radiation". The CMB is faint cosmic background radiation filling all space. It is an 
    important source of data on the early universe because it is the oldest 
    electromagnetic radiation in the universe, dating to the epoch of recombination. With 
    a traditional optical telescope, the space between stars and galaxies (the background) 
    is completely dark.

     <br>
      However, a sufficiently sensitive radio telescope shows a faint 
    background noise, or glow, almost isotropic, that is not associated with any star, 
    galaxy, or other object. This glow is strongest in the microwave region of the radio 
    spectrum. The accidental discovery of the CMB in 1965 by American radio astronomers 
    Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson was the culmination of work initiated in the 1940s, and 
    earned the discoverers the 1978 Nobel Prize in Physics.
